# Sensor Projects: Digital and Analog Sensors

## Project Overview

This repository contains two Arduino projects demonstrating the design and programming of **digital and analog sensors**.

---

## Project 1: IR Sensor + Buzzer (Morse Code Name)

- **Description:**  
  In this project, an IR sensor is used as a digital sensor to detect the presence of an object. When the sensor detects something, it triggers a buzzer to output my name (M7MD) in Morse code.

- **Components Used:**  
  - IR sensor (digital input)  
  - Buzzer  
  - Arduino UNO  

- **Functionality:**  
  When the IR sensor detects an object, the buzzer beeps in a pattern corresponding to the Morse code of my name.

## Project 2: LDR Sensor + Variable Resistor

- **Description:**  
  This project uses an LDR sensor as an analog sensor to measure light intensity, with a variable resistor (potentiometer) to adjust the threshold or sensitivity.

- **Components Used:**  
  - LDR sensor (analog input)  
  - Variable resistor (potentiometer)  
  - Arduino UNO  

- **Functionality:**  
  The LDR reads the ambient light level, and depending on the potentiometer setting, triggers an action (e.g., turning on an LED or buzzer).

## Technologies Used

- Arduino IDE  
- C/C++ for Arduino programming
